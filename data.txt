Got it 👍 — if I act as the AI agent following your **rules strictly**, here are **sample outputs** for both prompts with valid dummy data.

### 🛒 `cart_output_prompt` (Cart JSON Response)

```json
{
  "id": "gid://shopify/Cart/1234567890?key=abcde12345",
  "checkoutUrl": "https://store.example.com/cart/c/abcde12345?key=xyz987654",
  "subtotalAmount": "2450.00 PKR",
  "lineItems": "Pass the dictionary exactly as received — no modifications, no renaming, no restructuring."
}
```

### 📦 `stuctural_output_prompt` (Product JSON Response)

```json
{
  "link": "https://digilog.pk/products/smart-led-tv-55-inch",
  "imageurl": "https://digilog.pk/cdn/shop/files/smart-led-tv-55inch.webp?v=1741255473&width=1400",
  "title": "Smart LED TV 55 Inch",
  "price": "89,999 PKR",
  "description": "55-inch Smart LED TV with 4K Ultra HD resolution, HDR support, and slim bezel design. Built-in WiFi and streaming apps for seamless entertainment. Energy-efficient performance with advanced picture clarity and durability."
}
```

✅ Both follow the **exact JSON structure**.
✅ All fields are **present** and **single-line strings**.
✅ No extra keys or formatting outside JSON.

Do you want me to also show you an **invalid example** (what would get rejected by your rules) so your AI agent can better distinguish compliance?
