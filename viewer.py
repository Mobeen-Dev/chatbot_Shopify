            "description": "ESP32-C3-Zero (without pin header) and ESP32-C3-Zero-M (with pin header) are tiny in size with castellated holes, making them easy to integrate into other host boards. ESP32-C3-Zero comes with an onboard Type-C USB connector, which exposes most of the unused pins in a small form factor. It adopts ESP32-C3FH4 as a System-on-Chip (SoC) that integrates low-power WiFi and BLE5 with 4MB Flash. In addition, there is a hardware encryption accelerator, RNG, HMAC, and Digital Signature modules to meet the safety requirements of IoT and provide peripheral interfaces. Moreover, its low-power working mode supports most application scenarios such as IoT, mobile devices, wearable electronic devices, and smart homes. Features Low-power SoC equipped with RISC-V 32-bit single-core processor, up to 160MHz main frequency. Supports 2.4GHz Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n) and Bluetooth® 5 (LE). 400KB of SRAM and 384KB ROM, and 4MB of onboard Flash memory. Castellated module and onboard ceramic antenna, allow soldering direct to carrier boards. Supports flexible clock, module power supply independent setting, and other controls to realize low power consumption in different scenarios. Integrated with USB serial port full-speed controller, 15 × GPIO pins allow flexible configuring pin functions. 3 × SPI, 1 × I2C, 2 × UART, 1 × I2S, 2 × ADC, etc. Hardware Description When using ESP32-C3-Zero with daughterboards, please avoid covering the ceramic antenna with PCB boards, metal, or plastic components. In ESP32-C3-Zero, GPIO12 to GPIO17 pins are not exposed; these pins are used for stacking the 4MB Flash. ESP32-C3-Zero uses GPIO10 to connect with WS2812 RGB LED. Please refer to the documentation link for WS2812 specifications. ESP32-C3-Zero does not employ a USB to UART chip. When flashing firmware, press and hold the BOOT button (GPIO9) and then connect the Type-C cable. The \"TX\" and \"RX\" markings on the board indicate the default UART0 pins for ESP32-C3-Zero. Specifically, TX is GPIO21, and RX is GPIO20. Hardware Connection Press the BOOT (GPIO9) key before connecting the Type-C cable each time download the firmware. Input 3.7V~6V for the castellated hole with 5V silkscreen when connecting the external power.

Here's a brief introduction to these three development approaches: CircuitPython is a programming language designed to simplify coding tests and learning on low-cost microcontroller boards. It is an open-source derivative of the MicroPython programming language, primarily aimed at students and beginners. CircuitPython development and maintenance are supported by Adafruit Industries. You can refer to development documentation for CircuitPython-related applications development. The GitHub library for CircuitPython allows for recompilation for custom development. MicroPython is an efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language. It includes a small subset of the Python standard library and has been optimized to run on microcontrollers and resource-constrained environments. You can refer to development documentation for MicroPython-related application development. The GitHub library for MicroPython allows for recompilation for custom development. The official libraries and support from Espressif Systems for C/C++ development make it convenient for rapid installation. For Windows 10 system: Users can select Arduino Or Visual Studio Code (ESP-IDF) as their Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Mac and Linux operating system users can refer to the official instructions. Additionally, you can find development manuals for ESP32 series Arduino and ESP-IDF development to assist you in the process. Arduino 1. Download and install Arduino IDE.2. Install ESP32 on the Arduino IDE as shown below, and you can refer to this link. Fill in the following link in the Additional Boards Manager URLs section of the Settings interface under File -> Preferences and save. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json Search esp32 on Board Manager to install, and restart Arduino IDE to take effect. 3. ESP32-C3-Zero does not have USB to UART chip mounted, you need to use the USB of ESP32-C3 as the download interface and Log print interface, and you need to enable USB CDC when using Arduino IDE. MicroPython 1. Download and install the latest Thonny, open Thonny IDE -> Configure interpreter..., as shown below: 2. Press the BOOT key on the board, connect it to the USB cable, find the device manager or the corresponding COM port, and download or run the demo. For more details, you can see #Hardware Connection. 3. Select the ESP32 series online MPY firmware to download according to the following steps. The Flash content of the development board will be cleared before downloading, and the whole download process lasts about 1 minute. 4. Download the local firmware using flash_download_tool according to the following figure. You can choose either step 3 or step 4, but we recommend to choose step 4. 5. Please refer to MicroPython Documentation and Release Note to program. Sample Demo Please refer to arduino-esp32 for Arduino sample demo or File -> examples on the Arduino IDE. Please refer to MicroPython development documentation and sample demo for mpy example.

            "description": "Arduino WiFi Board MKR1000 is a powerful board that combines the functionality of the Zero and the Wi-Fi Shield. It is the ideal solution for makers wanting to design IoT projects with minimal previous experience in networking. Arduino MKR1000 has been designed to offer a practical and cost-effective solution for makers seeking to add Wi-Fi connectivity to their projects with minimal previous experience in networking. This WiFi board is based on the Atmel ATSAMW25 SoC (System on Chip), that is part of the SmartConnect family of Atmel Wireless devices, specifically designed for IoT projects and devices. The ATSAMW25 is composed of three main blocks: SAMD21 Cortex-M0+ 32bit low power ARM MCU WINC1500 low power 2.4GHz IEEE® 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi ECC508 CryptoAuthentication The ATSAMW25 includes also a single 1x1 stream PCB Antenna. The design includes a Li-Po charging circuit that allows the Arduino/Genuino MKR1000 to run on battery power or external 5V, charging the Li-Po battery while running on external power. Switching from one source to the other is done automatically. A good 32-bit computational power similar to the Zero board, the usual rich set of I/O interfaces, low power Wi-Fi with a Cryptochip for secure communication, and the ease of use of the Arduino Software (IDE) for code development and programming. All these features make this board the preferred choice for the emerging IoT battery-powered projects in a compact form factor. The USB port can be used to supply power (5V) to the board. This Arduino board is able to run with or without the Li-Po battery connected and has limited power consumption. The MKR1000 Wifi module supports certificate SHA-256. Warning: Unlike most Arduino & Genuino boards, the MKR1000 runs at 3.3V. The maximum voltage that the I/O pins can tolerate is 3.3V. Applying voltages higher than 3.3V to any I/O pin could damage the board. While output to 5V digital devices is possible, bidirectional communication with 5V devices needs proper level shifting. Features Of Arduino WiFi Board Module MKR100: Based on: Atmel ATSAMW25 SoC Operating Voltage: 3.3V USB Input Voltage (recommended): 5V Digital I/O Pins: 8 PWM Digital I/O Pins: 4 Analog Input Pins: 6 Analog Output Pins: 1 Flash Memory: 256Kb SRAM: 32Kb Clock Speed: 48Mhz WiFi, Encryption Chip, LiPo Battery Charger Specifications Of Arduino MKR1000 Board: Microcontroller: SAMD21 Cortex-M0+ 32bit low power ARM MCU Board Power Supply (USB/VIN): 5V Supported Battery(*): Li-Po single cell, 3.7V, 700mAh minimum Circuit Operating Voltage: 3.3V Digital I/O Pins: 8 PWM Pins: 12 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, A3 - or 18 -, A4 -or 19) UART: 1 SPI: 1 I2C: 1 Analog Input Pins: 7 (ADC 8/10/12 bit) Analog Output Pins: 1 (DAC 10 bit) External Interrupts: 8 (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, A1 -or 16-, A2 - or 17) DC Current per I/O Pin: 7 mA Flash Memory: 256 KB SRAM: 32 KB EEPROM: No Clock Speed: 32.768 kHz (RTC), 48 MHz LED BUILTIN: 6 Full-Speed USB Device and embedded Host: Yes Length: 61.5 mm Width: 25 mm Weight: 32 gr.
